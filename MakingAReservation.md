* If you have the appropriate permissions and need to be able to disconnect from your reservation without the reservation timing out, you can check the box for **Disable timeout for disconnected users** (this permission is granted by adding users to the [Allow No User Check](special+user+groups.html) user group)

* Choose when you would like to use the environment. Select **Now** if you would like to use the environment immediately. Select **Later** to select a time in the future to schedule the use of the environment.

* If access has been granted to your account, you will see an **At this time option**. This may be used to create long duration reservations. Server reservations also allow the option of selecting an indefinite end time.
